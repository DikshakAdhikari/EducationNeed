Education shows us the importance of hard work and, at the same time, helps us grow and develop. Thus, we are able to shape a better society to live in by knowing and respecting rights, laws, and regulations.Needs which comprise both essential learning tools (such as literacy, oral expression, numeracy, and problem solving) and the basic learning content (such as knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes) required by human beings to be able to survive, to develop their full capacities, to live and work in dignity, to participate fully in development, to improve the quality of their lives, to make informed decisions, and to continue learning. The scope of basic learning needs and how they should be met varies with individual countries and cultures, and inevitably, changes with the passage of time.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Indian Education system is often scrutinized by all the stakeholders. Students complain that the system tests their memory and not their intelligence; parents complain about the system promoting nothing but a rat race; teachers complaining about students not catching up with the syllabus. But if we all stop for a moment and look back into why we are learning the way we are and how we have adapted to the global trend, the white noise vanishes.
We were and are considered to be the beacon of light, the centre of learning since ancient times. As said before, to eliminate the white noise we should understand how we got here. Unlike the Occident, there was something very unique about the way education was taking place back here in India.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow Together</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the medium that gives us the skills, techniques, information and knowledge to know, understand and respect the duties we have towards our society, families and the nation. Without quality education, children face considerable barriers to employment and earning potential later in life. They are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes and less likely to participate in decisions that affect them â€“ threatening their ability to shape a better future for themselves and their societies. Therefore, the magnitude of the importance of education in life is huge as well as multifold.  The importance of education in life is that it helps everyone develop a good perspective of looking at the world and our society. Education helps us in getting new ideas and exploring new ideas.</p>
